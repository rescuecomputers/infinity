# infinity
inifity test project
Requirements:
1. Write code in a programming language (or languages, configuration management platforms, etc.) of your choice that provisions an environment running on the Linux or Windows operating system (You can choose any supported version of Linux or Windows). The infrastructure code only needs to provision the environment resources and configure a web server. The home page should display a static HTML page with the words: “To infiniti and beyond!” . There should be a single command that launches this environment.
2. Commit all code to a public version­control repository of your choice (e.g. Github) and provide usage instructions.
EXTRA: Write automated infrastructure tests to verify the environment works as expected

Solution is an AWS hosted URL (HOSTNAME) that will provision environment and return the URL of the hosted page.
